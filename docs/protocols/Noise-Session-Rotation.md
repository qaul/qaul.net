# Noise KK Session Rotation

This document describes the Noise KK session rotation protocol used by qaul to provide forward secrecy (PFS), backward (post-compromise) security, and bounded resistance to long-running session compromise — without breaking qaul's tolerance for delayed and out-of-order messages.

The implementation lives in `rust/libqaul/src/services/crypto/`; the network-format messages are defined in `protobuf/proto_definitions/services/crypto/crypto_net.proto`.

## Goals

A node-to-node Noise KK session is normally long-lived in qaul: it is established on first contact and kept until one peer goes away. That gives an attacker who compromises the static keys an open-ended window in which to read traffic. Session rotation closes that window on a configurable schedule:

- **Forward secrecy (PFS).** Compromise of the current session's transport keys must not let an attacker decrypt messages from previous sessions.
- **Backward / post-compromise security.** Compromise of a session must not let an attacker decrypt messages sent after a successful rotation, assuming the attacker is not active during the rotation handshake itself.
- **Configurable rotation period.** Both *time-based* (rotate when the session has been alive longer than N seconds) and *volume-based* (rotate when the session has carried more than M messages) triggers, configurable per node.
- **Delay tolerance.** A legitimately delayed or reordered message sent under the previous session must still decrypt for a bounded grace window after the rotation completes. qaul nodes routinely buffer messages on custodian nodes for hours or days, so any rotation strategy that drops in-flight traffic at the rotation boundary would visibly break direct chat.

## Approach: full session rotation, not a per-message ratchet

A per-message symmetric ratchet (Signal-style) gives strong PFS but is hostile to qaul's delay-tolerant model. qaul's `CryptoState` already tracks `out_of_order_indexes` so that messages arriving out of nonce order — or arriving days later from a custodian — still decrypt against a single transport cipher. A per-message ratchet would either drop those messages or require keeping every intermediate ratchet state indefinitely.

The chosen approach is **full session rotation**: re-run the existing `Noise_KK_X25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256` handshake on a schedule, keeping the previous session alive for a short, bounded grace period during which it can still *receive* (but not send) messages. This:

- reuses the existing handshake machinery,
- requires no change to message routing for in-flight traffic (every encrypted payload already carries a `session_id`),
- preserves the existing out-of-order tolerance within each session,
- and adds storage that is strictly additive to the current `CryptoState` rows.

## Trigger model

A node fires a rotation for a peer when any of the following becomes true:

- **time:** `now − session.established_at ≥ rotation_period`
- **outbound volume:** `session.index_nonce_out ≥ rotation_volume`
- **inbound volume:** `session.highest_index_nonce_in ≥ rotation_volume`
- **manual:** an operator forces a rotation via the `TriggerRotationRequest` RPC (e.g. `qauld-ctl crypto rotate --user-id …`).

Either side may initiate. If both sides trip a trigger close enough in time to start handshakes concurrently, the **lower numeric `new_session_id` wins**: the loser drops its `HalfOutgoing` row and processes the winner's incoming `RotateHandshakeFirst` instead. Ties are not possible in practice (32-bit random session ids), but if they did occur the implementation defensively prefers the local rotation.

Defaults — defined in `libqaul::storage::configuration::CryptoRotation`:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch; ships dormant for backward-compatible rollout. |
| `period_seconds` | `7 * 24 * 3600` | Rotate when the session is older than 7 days. |
| `volume_messages` | `2^20` | Rotate after ~1 M messages on the session. |
| `grace_period_seconds` | `3600` | How long the previous session stays decryptable after rotation. |
| `grace_volume_messages` | `256` | How many extra messages the previous session may still receive. |

The grace period is intended to cover one round-trip-time estimate for the worst legitimate delay we want to tolerate. It is clamped in design at `[1 min, 24 h]`; the upper bound is what trades us PFS strength against UX, and the lower bound prevents pathological configurations that would retire the previous session before the responder has had a chance to confirm.

Per-node policy is **not** negotiated. Peers with stricter policies rotate more aggressively; both sides converge because rotation is symmetric once triggered (either side's rotation produces a valid new shared session).

## Protocol

Rotation re-runs Noise KK under a fresh `session_id'`, while the old session remains usable for receiving only. Three frames carry the rotation, all encapsulated in a `CryptoserviceContainer` (see `protobuf/proto_definitions/services/crypto/crypto_net.proto`) and encrypted under the existing transport session:

```protobuf
message RotateHandshakeFirst {
    uint32 new_session_id = 1;
    bytes  noise_e        = 2;
    bytes  nonce          = 3;   // 16 random bytes, see "Anti-replay"
    uint64 initiated_at   = 4;
}

message RotateHandshakeSecond {
    uint32 new_session_id = 1;
    bytes  noise_e        = 2;
    bytes  nonce          = 3;   // echoed from RotateHandshakeFirst
    bytes  signature      = 4;
    uint64 received_at    = 5;
}
```

### Sequence

1. **Initiator** picks a random 32-bit `session_id'`, runs Noise KK step 1 with fresh ephemerals (a brand-new `CryptoState` saved as `HalfOutgoing` under `{remote_id, session_id'}`), and sends `RotateHandshakeFirst` encrypted under the current (still-primary) session.
2. **Responder** validates, runs KK step 2, persists the new `CryptoState` as `Transport`, **moves the previous primary into the draining slot**, and sends `RotateHandshakeSecond` back — also encrypted under the *previous* session, since the initiator has not promoted yet.
3. **Initiator** verifies the echoed nonce, finalises KK step 2, and flips its own meta: new session is now primary, old session is draining.
4. The draining session is kept for `grace_period_seconds` or until `grace_volume_messages` messages have been accepted on it, whichever comes first.
5. On expiry, the draining `CryptoState` row's transport keys (`cipher_in`, `cipher_out`) are zeroized and the row is removed. A `GraceExpired` event is emitted.

The `nonce` field carries the "nonce-based" anti-replay binding suggested in the original concept: a fresh 16-byte random value stamped on each rotation. The responder echoes it in `RotateHandshakeSecond`; the initiator verifies the echo. A replayed `RotateHandshakeFirst` cannot resurrect an already-retired session because the initiator side has no pending state matching the replayed nonce.

### Receiver routing

Every encrypted payload carries `session_id`, so receiver logic is straightforward:

| Incoming `session_id` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| matches `primary` | decrypt with primary, normal path. |
| matches `draining`, nonce ≤ declared final (`draining_recv_target`) | decrypt with draining, normal out-of-order handling; record the nonce in the drain bitmap. |
| matches `draining`, nonce > declared final | **refuse** before decrypting, emit `MessageDroppedPostDrain`. The cut-over ACK fixed the last legitimate old-session nonce; a sender overrunning it is not accepted. While the final nonce is still unknown (ACK not yet received) nothing is refused. |
| matches `last_retired_session_id` | drop, emit `MessageDroppedPostDrain` — UI surfaces "message expired, ask sender to resend." |
| unknown, from a peer with an active session | treat as a fresh first-handshake attempt. |

This is the *final-nonce boundary* from the 1st-July rotation spec: the in-flight tail up to the sender's declared final nonce stays deliverable across the rotation, but nothing above it is accepted, so a peer cannot keep the old session alive indefinitely by continuing to send on it.

## State

Per-peer rotation state lives in a sled tree `rotation_meta` (one row per `remote_id`), separately from the existing `CryptoState` rows:

```rust
pub struct RotationMeta {
    primary_session_id:           u32,
    pending_initiated_session_id: Option<u32>,
    draining_session_id:          Option<u32>,
    draining_until:               Option<u64>,
    draining_remaining_volume:    Option<u64>,
    last_retired_session_id:      Option<u32>,
    last_retired_at:              Option<u64>,
}
```

During a rotation a peer may have **two `CryptoState` rows** (primary + draining) for a brief window. The `primary_session_id` field on `rotation_meta` disambiguates which row is authoritative for new outbound traffic — important on the responder side, where there is a moment between "we completed step 2" and "the initiator sent its first message under the new session" when both rows are in `Transport` state.

`last_retired_*` is the bookkeeping that lets the decrypt path detect "message arrived after grace" (and emit `MessageDroppedPastGrace`) instead of treating an old-session frame as an unknown new-handshake attempt.

## Capability negotiation

A node will not initiate a rotation with a peer that has not advertised support. `UserInfo.capabilities` (a `uint32` bitset on the routing layer's `UserInfo`) carries this advertisement; bit 0 (`Capabilities::ROTATION = 0x1`) is set by every binary that contains rotation code. A peer running an older binary sends `capabilities = 0` (or omits the field entirely, which decodes to 0), and the gate in `Crypto::perform_rotation` refuses to rotate with them. Without this gate, a `RotateHandshakeFirst` to a legacy peer would be silently dropped, leaving the initiator with a dangling `HalfOutgoing` row.

## Events

The crypto module emits a small in-memory ring buffer (cap 256) of rotation events for client tooling and the UI:

- `Rotated` — a rotation finalised on this node; `primary_session_id` and `draining_session_id` are populated.
- `GraceExpired` — a draining session's grace window elapsed and its keys were zeroized.
- `MessageDroppedPastGrace` — an inbound message arrived under a session id whose grace window had already been retired.

Clients query the log via `GetRotationEventsRequest`. The buffer is intentionally not persisted: rotation history is already observable on-wire to an adversary, and an on-disk log would add a forensic artefact with no clear defender benefit.

## Configuration and operator surface

The `CryptoRotation` config is read and written via the `Modules::Crypto` RPC (`crypto_rpc.proto`):

- `GetConfigRequest` / `GetConfigResponse` — read current config.
- `SetConfigRequest` / `SetConfigResponse` — partial update, validated server-side; zero-valued numeric fields are rejected to prevent foot-guns.
- `GetRotationEventsRequest` / `GetRotationEventsResponse` — query the event log with optional `since_ms` lower bound and `limit` cap.
- `TriggerRotationRequest` / `TriggerRotationResponse` — operator-level manual rotate, bypasses time/volume triggers but still respects the capability gate and "rotation already in flight" guard.

Both `qaul-cli` and `qauld-ctl` expose these via a `crypto` subcommand:

```sh
qauld-ctl crypto config                 # show current config
qauld-ctl crypto enable                 # flip master switch on
qauld-ctl crypto set --period-seconds 86400 --volume-messages 100000
qauld-ctl crypto rotate --user-id <peer>
qauld-ctl crypto events --limit 20
```

## Threat model and limits

- **Replay of an old `RotateHandshakeFirst`** — prevented by the per-rotation `nonce` and by the requirement that the rotation frame is authenticated under the *current* session. An attacker who replays an older frame produces a duplicate that the initiator's `pending_initiated_session_id` check rejects.
- **Grace too short → lost messages** — configurable; default tuned for qaul's DTN latency. The UI surfaces `MessageDroppedPastGrace` so the user is told why a delivery failed.
- **Grace too long → weakened PFS** — design hard upper bound of 24 h on `grace_period_seconds`; operators tune the trade-off downward as their threat model demands.
- **State bloat** — at most two `CryptoState` rows per peer are retained at any time; the drain ticker (60 s interval) zeroizes and removes draining state on expiry.
- **Identity-key compromise (out of scope).** Rotation derives forward secrecy from new ephemerals, not from new static keys. An attacker who has stolen a peer's static identity key can decrypt a fresh rotation by impersonating the peer at handshake time. Identity-key compromise is recovered only by reissuing the user's qaul ID, which is a separate concern.

## Rollback

Rotation is gated by `CryptoRotation::enabled` (defaults to `false`). To disable in the field:

1. Set `enabled = false` via `SetConfigRequest` (or edit `config.yaml`).
2. Existing long-lived sessions continue to work unchanged.
3. No on-disk migration is required: the `rotation_meta` tree is additive and ignored when rotation is off.

In-flight rotations at the moment of disable complete naturally (the daemon is not interrupted mid-handshake); subsequent triggers are simply not fired.
