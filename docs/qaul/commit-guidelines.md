# Commit Guidelines

This is our best praxis guide for committing to the qaul project.
We value every contribution to the project!

## Pull Request & Commit Structure

* Please organize the commits by functionality.
  * Please write your commit messages in accordance with the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.
* Please structure your work in feature branches.
* Make separate commits for comment typo & coding style fixes, if they are not directly in the functions you're working on.

### Before Pull Request

Please always rebase your feature branch to the main branch before doing a pull request.

#### How to Rebase your Branch against Main Branch

Rebasing puts your commits on top of the main branch.

```sh
# checkout main branch and pull latests changes to make
# sure it is up to date.
checkout main
git pull

# checkout your_branch and rebase it against main branch
checkout your_branch
git rebase main

# now you can push your_branch to github and create
# a pull request.
```

You can use rebasing also during development to bring the latest
changes from main branch to your_branch.
