# Social Documentation

This section outlines social structures of the qaul.net project, to
make engaging with us as easy as possible!


## Communication

The qaul.net projet uses [matrix] as development and social chat. Feel
free to drop by!

Our [community mailing list] is for long-form discussion and work log
updates.  You can post questions there, show off your projects using
`libqaul` or submit patches!  The mailing list usually is mixed volume.

We also have an [announcement mailing list], which is very low volume,
where you will get informed about new versions and releases of the
qaul.net software and occasional project related news.

We have an open weekly developer voice chat meeting.  We are meeting
Mondays, at 17:00 UTC on the online platform [jitsi].  The meetings
are announced on the community mailing list, where you can find the
records of the meetings as well.  They are open and free to join for
everyone, feel free to drop in. *Note: weekly voice chat's have been
paused for the time being*

## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for qaul.net and the development community around it.
Because of this we follow the ["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].
A copy of it should have been included in the sources for this book.
