# qaul.net [![pipeline status](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/commits/master)

**qaul.net** is an Internet independent ad-hoc wireless mesh-network 
suite that harnesses the power of everyday devices such as computers and 
smartphones to create a **Non-Centralized**, **Mesh Network** on which 
users can share files, have voice chats and send each other messages, 
however the power of qaul.net allows endless services over the service 
API. qaul.net removes the dependence on the centralized services such as 
the Internet and cellular networks and creates a network that anyone can 
be part of and share freely with no censorship what so ever.
