//! An I/O abstraction module for the qrpc system
//!
//! The qrpc system heavily builds on capnproto as an exchange and RPC
//! format.  Unfortunately the capnproto-rs interface is pretty shit
//! (this is rude, I know but it's just not great...).  Having to
//! interact with it to write services for qaul.net might be a dealbreaker.
//!
//! And so... this module tries to abstract as much of the low-level
//! ugliness away.  Instead, you pass it a buffer with a message, and
//! it parses it for you, with some simple type constraits that are
//! easy to enforce in your application.  Additionally, it exposes
//! some more convenient builders as well (although the builder APIs
//! in the original crate are quite good).
